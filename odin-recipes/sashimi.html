         <h1>Description</h1>
         <h2>What Is Sashimi?</h2>
        <p id="intro">
        Sashimi is a fresh fish that is served raw and thinly sliced. It is a traditional Japanese offering that's often served with daikon radish, pickled ginger, wasabi or soy sauce. Commonly used seafoods are salmon, tuna, halibut, and squid.
        </p>
        <p id="tip">
        Many Japanese restaurants keep the fish alive in tanks before they are selected and prepared for consumption. A sashimi-grade seafood is caught with what is known as an individual hand line instead of a fishing net. The fish is harvested and immediately placed on ice which helps to keep it fresh longer.
