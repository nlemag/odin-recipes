         <h4>What Is Sashimi?</h4>
        <p>
        Sashimi is a fresh fish that is served raw and thinly sliced. It is a traditional Japanese offering that's often served with daikon radish, pickled ginger, wasabi or soy sauce. Commonly used seafoods are salmon, tuna, halibut, and squid.
        </p>
        <p>
        Many Japanese restaurants keep the fish alive in tanks before they are selected and prepared for consumption. A sashimi-grade seafood is caught with what is known as an individual hand line instead of a fishing net. The fish is harvested and immediately placed on ice which helps to keep it fresh longer.
